# Fake Services

We use the package json-server (with either a generated json file or a file which programattically generates data) when we want dummy data of our own.

Try it... Clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:jmsherry/fake-server.git` and install the dependancies `yarn`.

Now run `npx json-server db.json` or `npx json-server guests.js` and go to the URLs shown.
